# CollageScript
**2012&#8212;2016**

CollageScript is a library of Javascript code I developed to automate the creation of large, multi-layered Photoshop files using ~~Adobe's ExtendScript Toolkit~~ *Visual Studio Code*. It was used to create a number of large-format digital print editions and series. See https://www.calhounsmith.com/portfolio/code-based/

CollageScript was also used, along with the mighty help of [CreateJS](https://github.com/createjs), to render animations. See https://www.calhounsmith.com/animation/riez-animation/riez/.

CollageScript code developed organically in response to functionality I needed as I made artwork over the period 2012 to 2016. The best way to get an idea of how this code is used is to look at the [example-script.js](example-script.js). This is the kind of script that could be written and then run from *Visual Studio Code* using the *ExtendScript Debugger* extension with the Photoshop API selected as the target. Take a look at the [example image](example-image.jpg) to see a final result &#8212; a Photoshop file containing over a thousand photographic fragments, each on its own layer.

## Note on lib directories
The contents of the `lib` directory is a stalled attempt to rewrite CollageScript from a couple years ago. The `lib-legacy` directory contains what were *the goods* in the day &#8212; the set of files used to generate many of the print editions which can be viewed at my [website](https://calhounsmith.com).
